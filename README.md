# student_roster
This was a performance assessment in my second term through the Software Development bachelor's degree. I had to create this C++ application from scratch, utilizing the information learned during the class and test my knowledge during this first time ever application development. There were many restrictions and constraints (such as using arrays instead of vectors and calling functions inside the main instead of elsewhere, for example) which limited or affected how the program had to be created and would look like. This application contains classes and subclasses and accessors and mutators to set and get data from these classes. It also filters students per specific degree, deletes a student from the array and provides the average of days needed to complete each of the 3 courses specified.
